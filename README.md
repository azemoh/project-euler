## Project Euler
#### Solving problems from Project Euler with Python

In an effort to learn Python, I will try to solve as many problems as I can or I have time to solve from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). I am also learning Ruby so I'll use Ruby for some of the solutions. I have just completed Codecademy's python [course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) and I have a basic(relatively) understanding of the language.

### Disclaimer
People are encouraged not to share solution to these problems, so if you ever intend to take the Euler challenge view the solutions at your own discretion. This is for my reference.
